    <div>
      <div class="statement-rules-content">The game is played on a platform in space. Due to Magus' poor AI skills Automaton2000 only walks in straight lines. Guide Automaton2000 with arrows to save him from stepping off the platform!<br>
        Unfortunately, due to Magus' poor coding Automaton2000 also crashes if he revisits a state he's been in, as he realises he's going in circles!<br>
        Try to keep Automaton2000 alive as long as possible, you score 1 point per turn that he is.<br>
        <br>
        The game works as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>The platform is a grid of height <const>10</const> and width <const>19</const></li>
          <li>You are given the layout of the platform in ascii form with <const>#</const>:void, <const>.</const>:platform, <const>U</const>:Up arrow, <const>R</const>:Right arrow, <const>D</const>:Down arrow, <const>L</const>:Left arrow</li>
          <li>Place arrows on your first turn by outputting in the format: <var>X Y U/R/D/L</var></li>
          <li>Automaton2000 moves in a straight line and only changes direction when stepping on an arrow</li>
        </ul>
        You may not place arrows on top of existing ones.
      </div>

      <span>Expert Rules</span>
    </h1>
    <div class="statement-expert-rules-content">
      Order of events in a turn:
      <ul>
        <li>Score is incremented by 1 for each Automaton2000 alive</li>
        <li>Automaton2000 moves by 1 cell in the direction he's facing</li>
        <li>Automaton2000 changes direction if he's located on an arrow</li>
        <li>Automaton2000 dies if he has stepped into the void or entered a (position,direction) state he has been in before</li>
      </ul>
      For the first turn Automaton2000 changes direction if he's standing on an arrow (i.e: You can change the initial direction of a robot by placing an arrow under it).
      You can run custom test cases in the IDE.
      You can access the referee code on a public github.
