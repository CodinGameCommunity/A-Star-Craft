    </h1>
    <div>
      <div class="statement-rules-content">The game is played on a platform in space. Help Automaton2000 patrol his platform by placing arrows to guide him!<br>
        Automaton2000 scores 1 point per cell he visits. If he steps off the platform and drifts into space he won't be able to score any more points!<br>
        Due to Magus' poor coding Automaton2000 crashes if he revisits a state he's been in, as he realises he's going in circles!
        <br>
        The game works as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>The platform is made up of discrete cells of coordinates (x,y)</li>
          <li>You are given the layout of the platform in ascii form with `#`:void, `.`:platform, `U`:Up arrow, `R`:Right arrow, `D`:Down arrow, `L`:Left arrow</li>
          <li>Place arrows on your first turn by outputting in the format: `X Y U/R/D/L`</li>
          <li>Automaton2000 moves in a straight line and only changes direction when stepping on an arrow</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Automaton2000 moves by 1 cell in the direction he's facing</li>

          <br>
          In the beginning when Magus created this world, it was formless and void.<br>
          And Magus said "Let there be a platform in the midst of the void, and let it separate the void from the void". And it was so.<br>
          And Magus created Automaton2000 in his image; buggy and simple-minded he created him.<br>
          And Magus saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was not very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.<br>
          Thus the cosmos was created.<br>
          And on the seventh day, while Magus is resting, we find ourselves having to guide his creation, delaying its perdition.<br>
